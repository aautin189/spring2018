ASSIGNMENT:
Homework #6
Exploration/Combat Duo Game




**************************************************

ALGORITHM:

1. Game Loop

- The player can explore the dungeon, selecting the direction she wants to travel in
- Occasionally, inside of a particular room, she will encounter a monster that she will be forced to fight
	- Before she can move onto the next room (before the loop can iterate again), she MUST kill that particular monster


2. Conditions that allow the player to exit the game (thus terminating the program)

- the player is killed by the monster 			(DEFEATED)  	--> at least she tried; accepted risk
- the player achieves a victory condition 		(WINS)		--> her efforts paid off


- the player decides it's too hard & quits 		(FORFEITS) 	--> she was a coward
